BYI

<p align="center">
i have avoidant personality disorder and some other stuff, so i get socially anxious very easily, and i'm just generally bad at social interaction.
<br> i don't mind if you interact, just be warned i don't make for a good conversation partner if i don't know you well, and you probably don't want to be friends with me if you don't want to deal with a mentally ill person.

if you have any concerns about something i did or said, please let me know, so i can consider them and improve.
